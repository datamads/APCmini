# APCmini (for OSX)
SuperCollider quark wrapper for the Akai APCmini controller

This is a modified version of the original APC mini script for SuperCollider that works for OSX (the original only worked on Linux). 

To use this, download this repo and put in your Quarks folder and then have a look at the original help file for the APCmini class for examples.
